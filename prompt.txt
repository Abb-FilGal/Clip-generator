"Generate a motivational speech directed at a young man, focusing on personal responsibility, discipline, and overcoming challenges. Use a strong, direct, and inspiring tone, reminiscent of Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson. Include themes of pushing past comfort, embracing struggle, and finding meaning in responsibility. The speech should be concise, around 100-130 words long and work as a loop, combining tough love with a sense of hope. Conclude with a powerful call to action that encourages him to take charge of his life."
