now you are not your past you're you you're you right now you might have done some things you wish you hadn't done don't dwell on that you can learn from it that's fine but don't dwell on it just keep moving it keep moving you don't use it use it as fuel Say Never Again I get what I did wrong but don't think that you're that person that made those mistakes you're the person who's learned I think that endurance enduring something and building up that ability to endure things that's also a very important mechanism that you could apply to everyday life like that the mechanism of understanding how to endure because of people just running from discomfort they're running from it they're just avoiding it so easy to and like if you get distracted for a second you like yeah let me check my phone just start going through your phone and looking at and you're just distracting yourself from the tiniest frustration of boredom just a little bit we don't get bored anymore if we get bored we get bored for these tiny amounts of time then you get distracted so you just tracking is eliminating your boredom but the problem with that is like the certain thoughts that only come to you when you thinking when you don't have any input coming in when we're constantly looking at our phones the only input you're getting is input from other people sometimes that's good sometimes you get good stuff out of that but it's like a diet of only fruit you know like you need some protein you need to get some other things in your diet and I think having discomfort in your diet like having it as a regular part of your life it minimizes the amount of other kinds of bullshit and I think that insanity and and greatness are next to our neighbors and they borrow each other this there's something about Mastery like true Mastery that requires you to shut off massive areas of your life personally areas relationships education my education was a joke I mean it's so I was 21 years old and I started doing stand-up comedy I didn't read books I mean I might have read a Stephen King book here and there for to kill time I was on the train on my way to training but there was no there's no desire to educate myself if I was educating myself it was maybe reading the book of five rings to learn better strategy to be a better fighter that was all it was was there ever a point where you said I'm a little out of balance I need to go the other way why I realize I was a flawed person for sure you know and I think in realizing your flawed you realize that you know realizing you know girls are getting mad at me or maybe guys get mad at me whatever it was I realize that I had flaws you know I knew I knew that I was and then also failing at comedy one of the hardest things to do is to go from being really great at something to sucking at something and that's something that you suck at is now your path you know and that's what I found myself in comedy you know I could get laughs every now and then but I wasn't anything special I knew I was terrible and it was something exciting about being terrible because I had potential because he was potential for growth you know if you if you start doing it and you're great at it like naturally like maybe I wouldn't have had the motivation to do it as a living for 25 years on I don't know but at that time you know making that transition from martial arts competition to being comedian that's when I started going down the road of balance and started trying to balance myself as a person and I started trying to almost educate myself to have more things to talk about on stage and then along the way my curiosity started to Blossom and then I started to just be interested in things for being interested in them and as I got better as a comedian I became less worried about what other people thought about me and more worried about just improving and keeping you know keeping this sort of momentum going and I was like relax more you know in having some success in life and sort of
